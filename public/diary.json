      "content": "Back at it again. The first thing I need is a navigation bar component in case I want to add routes and more pages later. Let's just add a simple extra page for cubing-corner for now. Looking good. Now I need to deploy it somewhere live with a custom domain. Remembered I still have a jumanji.work domain that I bought to test stuff last year. Will use that with Vercel to deploy a live site. Required changing my Cloudflare DNS record to point to Vercel. It's all working as expected very happy. Ah it's 11pm, time to play League with Jovana. Great progress will continue on, lots of motivation atm."

      "content": "Saturday lots of time. First gonna start by cleaning up unnecessary file to start on a clean slate. Let's add some dummy text for the cubing-corner page for now to populate it. Also adding a video player and carousel of sorts to it. It works, has buttons to go between videos and used free online videos to test it. Now need a way to store my shadowplay videos online. Compared between Amazon S3 and Cloudflare R2 object storage. R2 has a generous 10gb per month should be enough. Uploaded 3 clips as test and created a new video-worker repo to handle the R2 bucket requests. Was a pain to get wrangler CLI working but end of the day got a working endpoint to use and get a list of all the video titles to craft the direct link to the videos stored. Looking amazing so far, very proud of the progress yay."

Encountered a CORS error but adding a wrapper around the Response fixed it. Added a home page to Navbar, a sort by feature for the clips and a dummy loading screen component. Everything working, need to finish off the thumbnails for the video carousel currently missing. Lots more work to go"

Added Kanban board extension on Vscode to keep track of all of my ideas. This feels great to sort my tasks into tickets and tick them off. Also added scrolling for the video carousel. Need to start looking into my idea of a pixel art loading screen. Thinking of a Pilee bird featured one since Jovana loves it."

Watched videos for like an hour to learn crash course on how to use it. Played around with it for a bit but damn is pixel animation difficult. Respect for animators. Also added a new dropdown in navbar to show the X dles link to loldle, octordle and wordle. Tried implementing iframes for all of them but encountering restrictions from embedding so just gonna link to them. Great new tool discovered can't wait to do more animation."

      "content": "Another Saturday, gonna have lots of time to work on it hehe. Started off by creating a theme toggle with our Discord icons as the toggle to switch between. Watched a lot of videos on colour design and maximising contrast. Played around with a tool called Realtime colours and discovered the working colour theme. I made a blueish theme for mine and a pinkish theme for Jovana. Used conditional styling to apply theme across entire website. Added a dummy music-corner for now. Now that clip corner is done let's focus on the cubing corner. I need some sort of way to display a rendered Rubik's cube so I can teach the steps and make it reusable otherwise it's a hassle. Scoured through soo many online implementations finally ended up with AnimCube3 which is a library that has everything I need. Had to fix the import to support Typescript and got a POC going. A lot of work done today and very satisfied."

Got OLL Part 1 and Part 2 instructions finished, spent ages customising styled the AnimCube3 component to be prettier and tinkering with the docs. Replaced the custom Theme provider with a library called next-themes. Lots of content update today great way to end the weekend."
